      - All blog/projects/other pages should now have acceptable levels of mobile readability
    ✓ - Must fix navbar on mobile (doesn't extent to full page width)

    New design for Blog Project Other homepage buttons
    Grid layout for /project and /other
    AdblockPlus default + custom filters
    Raspberry Pi Cluster blog post
    
    New site-wide font?
    "You are leaving JamieWeb" for outbound links?
