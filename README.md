## Site To-do/Ideas List:
    Better mobile compatibility
    ✓ - All blog/projects/other pages should now have acceptable levels of mobile readability
    ✓ - Must fix navbar on mobile (doesn't extent to full page width)
      - Must fix homepage on mobile (currently quite unpredictable) - will be fixed along with new Blog Project Other buttons
    
    New design for Blog Project Other homepage buttons
    Grid/list layout for /projects

    PHP blog list generation - efficiency?
    IPv6 - (2a01:4020:1::129)
