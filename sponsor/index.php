    <h1>Sponsoring jamieweb.net</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>My website <a href="/" target="_blank">jamieweb.net</a> has a highly targeted audience of people interested in cyber security, software development, internet privacy, open-source and Linux.</p>
    <p>A sponsorship provides the opportunity for you to promote your brand or product directly to between 7,000 and 8,000 unique human visitors per month.</p>

    <h2 id="pricing">Pricing</h2>
    <p>One month of sponsorship currently costs <b>$20 US</b>, however this is up for negotiation.</p>
    <p>If you wish to sponsor me for multiple months, there will be a discount. I can accept the following payment methods:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>UK bank transfer</li>
        <li>PayPal</li>
        <li>Bitcoin (or other reputable cryptocurrency, upon agreement)</li>
        <li>Other of your choice (if possible)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you're interested, please <a href="#contact">contact me</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="sponsor-message">Sponsor Message</h2>
    <p>A sponsorship allows you to place a branded message of your choice in a banner at the top of every page on my website. The message should be a maximum of 140 characters, and will be hyperlinked to a page of your choosing.</p>
    <p>I have included examples of the sponsorship message banner below:</p>
    <h3 id="sponsor-message-desktop">Desktop:</h3>
    <img class="max-width-100-percent border-2px-solid radius-8" src="/sponsor/desktop.png" alt="A screenshot of an example sponsor message appearing on a desktop web browser." title="An Example Sponsor Message Appearing on a Desktop Web Browser">
